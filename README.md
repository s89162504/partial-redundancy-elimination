Partial Redundancy Elimination (PRE)
====================================

PRE is a compiler optimization that eliminates
expressions that are redundant on some but not necessarily all paths through a
program. We implement a PRE optimization pass in the LLVM framework, and evaluate the benefits 
on a variety of applications. PRE is a powerful technique that subsumes 
Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE) and Loop Invariant Code Motion (LICM), and hence has a potential to 
greatly improve performance.
